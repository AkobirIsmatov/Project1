# Interactive CV Website

A single-page portfolio for Akobir Ismatov built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. All resume content is loaded from `CV_info.json` so the page stays in sync with the data file.

## Features
- Dynamic sections for About, Education, Experience, Skills, Projects, Publications, Certifications, Achievements and Contact.
- Responsive navigation with hamburger menu, active link highlighting and a back-to-top button.
- Dark/light theme toggle that remembers the visitor's preference.
- Scroll progress bar, section reveal animations and a subtle 3D tilt effect that responds to cursor movement.
- Matrix-style side canvases and looping code snippets for a developer aesthetic.
- Font Awesome icons for skills and job roles plus a downloadable PDF version of the CV.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser. No build step or server is required.

## Customization
- Update `CV_info.json` with your own information to regenerate the page content.
- Replace images or documents in `assets/` (profile photo, favicon, downloadable CV).
- Modify `style.css` or `script.js` to adjust styling or behavior.
